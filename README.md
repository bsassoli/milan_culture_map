# culturemapp
Culturemapp is an interactive, dynamic web app mapping over 400 cultural venues in the city of Milan, Italy. 

The dataset and the methodolody for the definition of what counts as a "cultural venue" were gathered and developed with the support of a team from the Municipality of Milan. 

## Homepage

* zoom in or out 
* filter venues by category
* search venues by venue name.

The homepage can be reached  by clicking on the culturemapp link in the navigation bar from any other page in the webapp.
